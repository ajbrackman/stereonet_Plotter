# First attempt at creating a stereonet plotting program in python using mplstereonet
# Testing git integrations

**_Python 2.7 required_**

Two versions currently exist:
## StereonetPlotter_fileinput.py
This script takes a CSV (strikesdips.csv) with strikes (in quadrant or azimuth) format and dip values (in degrees), prints these to the console and plots planes and poles on an equal area stereonet.

## StereonetPlotter_SingleInput.py
This script prompts the user to enter a strike (in quadrant or azimuth) and a dip value (in degrees) and then plots the plane and pole on an equal area stereonet using a new color for each entry.
